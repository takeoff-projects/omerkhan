  Engineering team culture at Takeoff

## Introduction

Please see our [company page](/company/) for more general information about Takeoff. You can see how our team is growing at the [Takeoff Contribute page.](/events/Takeoff-contribute/)


## Life at Takeoff

![image](/images/en/docs/Culture/town.jpg)

It’s an exciting time to be part of Takeoff. We're a fast-growing, all-remote team, and we're looking for people to join us around the world.
Here's a look at what you can expect from our culture and [all-remote environment](/company/culture/all-remote/guide/).

### Everyone can contribute

Our size and [our mission](/company/mission/#mission) (that everyone can contribute) mean that our team members can — and are expected to — make an impact across the company.

Because we all use our product internally, you don't have to be a developer to learn to collaborate in the Takeoff tool.
From your very first week, no matter your role, you'll gain the technical skills needed to access, question, and contribute to projects far beyond your job description.

This unique approach works because we're a team of helpful, passionate people who want to see each other, the company, and the broader Takeoff community succeed.
We learn from each other, challenge each other, and thank each other.

Come prepared to do meaningful work that will help shape the future of the company.

While the opportunities to contribute are boundless in a growing organization like Takeoff, they may not be clearly defined.
You'll need to think creatively, speak up to see how you can help, and be willing to try something new.

### Freedom to iterate

At Takeoff, our [value of iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration) has a unique impact on the way we operate and get things done.

Working this way means our team members are expected to quickly deliver the minimum viable change in their work instead of waiting to produce a polished, completed product.

While this can be a challenging practice to adopt at first, it's liberating to be able to make mistakes, get feedback quickly, and course correct to reach a better outcome, faster.

As our company and the industry continue to grow, you'll have the freedom to change and constantly evolve everything from your schedule and your workspace to your job description and your skills.


## Culture at Takeoff

<!-- ![Takeoff values](/images/all-remote/Takeoff-values-tanukis.jpg) -->

Culture at Takeoff is established in the following ways.

1. Work style (how we work). This is defined and articulated in our [values](/handbook/values/) and [handbook](/handbook/handbook-usage/).
1. Camaraderie (mutual trust and friendship). This is created and maintained by [informal communication](/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/).

In other organizations, culture may be defined through the *personality of the group*. This includes people who have traits in common and people who you enjoy spending time with. Note that this is not something that should matter when [evaluating people for work](/handbook/values/#culture-fit-is-a-bad-excuse), and this is not what we mean with Culture at Takeoff.

## Team Stories

What better way to convey a sense of who we are and how we work together, than by sharing the stories about it?


### The Boat

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8 col-xm-12"><img src="/images/blogimages/boat.jpg" alt="The Boat"></div>
  <div class="col-md-4 col-xm-12">
    <p><a href="/blog/2016/01/06/our-y-combinator-experience/">Back then</a>, the whole team used to fit in one car. And the car was called "the Boat".</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xm-12">
    <p>We even took the Boat from San Francisco to Las Vegas to celebrate Job's bachelor party, but as you can see in this video, he thought we were going to visit a customer in Los Angeles!</p>

### The cattle

<br>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4 col-xm-12"><img class="cattle" src="/images/cattle_stare.JPG" alt="Staring down cattle"></div>
  <div class="col-md-8 col-xm-12">
    <h4 class="media-heading">Staring down the cattle?</h4>
    <p class="justify-1">Our CFO, Paul, was on vacation on a cattle ranch,
    during a time of fundraising. Normally vacation is vacation of course, but
    in this case it was necessary to have some calls now and again which
    required strong internet. To get to strong internet, Paul had to cross
    fields with cattle in them, and stare them down. Over the course of many
    trips he learned that cattle are docile, mostly... but don't turn your back
    on them because they can't be outrun!</p>

### IPO date comes in handy... 2 years out

  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xm-12">
    <p>After spending a couple of days in meetings with customers in New York City, USA, Sid and Kirsten had a few hours before their flight and wanted to visit the WTC Observatory deck. It didn't work out but our IPO date did work out in their favor. In the keynote at our Cape Town event, Sid explains what happened.</p>
