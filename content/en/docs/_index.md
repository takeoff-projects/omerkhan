Welcome!!! to the Engineering Handbook, a single source of truth for everyone in the Engineering group here at Takeoff. This a permanent resource, designed to cover all aspects of engineering life here at Takeoff Technologies.


## Who is this handbook for?
This handbook is meant for anyone and everyone in the Takeoff Technologies engineering family.


## Why do we need a handbook?
We all need a helping hand at some point and joining a new organization, team, domain or even project can require a lot documentation and even more learning. This handbook is designed to be a one-stop location for guidance for everything related to day-to-day life as a Takeoff Engineering team member. 
It is also designed to be a single source of truth, encompassing everything from onboarding, to asynchronous culture, meeting conduct, to submitting an IT ticket, to learning resources and many areas in between.

For even more information about a handbook-first appraoch, see [Handbook-first Methodology](/handbook_first.html).

## Who are the Authors?
Materials in this handbook have been sourced from our engineering team members, with the first few pages being compiled by Engineering Management to get the ball rolling. We welcome and encourage contributions from everyone on engineering!
