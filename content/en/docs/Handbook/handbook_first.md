  Why a Handbook-first approach is vital to our success as a modern hybrid-remote global company.

## Introduction

A handbook-first approach to documentation is vital to a well-run business. While it feels skippable — inefficient, even — the outsized benefits of intentionally writing down and organizing process, culture, and solutions are staggering. Conversely, *avoiding* structured documentation is the best way to instill a low-level sense of chaos and confusion that hampers growth across the board. 

Takeoff Engineering is intentional about documenting in a manner that creates a single source of truth. It operates handbook-first, and in valuing transparency, welcomes anyone on the Takeoff Engineering team to contribute. 

##  Terminology (documentation, handbook-first, single source of truth)

While the term documentation often refers to the process of writing something down *after* a given event, this page details a more meaningful approach. Documentation should occur *first*, in a structured and organized way, *before* being disseminated. (E.g. Document the solution first, *then* announce via Slack or email.) 

The goal isn't to create a culture of documenting for the sake of documenting; rather, to create an environment where net new solutions are documented in a universally accessible handbook before dissemination, and iterations are made to the universally recognized single source of truth. Each team member must approach documentation the same way, much like an editorial team adheres to a [style guide](/handbook/handbook-styleguide/). 

## Why does handbook-first documentation matter?

In early-stage startups, it's particularly tempting to avoid a documentation strategy. With only a few team members, it's feasible to keep everyone informed via meetings, Slack, or email threads. Long-term, this oversight becomes increasingly harmful. 

As a team scales, the **need** for documentation increases in parallel with the **cost** of not doing it. Said another way, implementing a documentation strategy becomes **more difficult** — yet **more vital** — as a company ages and matures. 

Documentation is rarely placed on the same pedestal with metrics such as sales and client retention during a company's formative years, but it deserves to be. The difference between a well-documented company and one that eschews a handbook is stark. 

A handbook-first organization is home to team members who benefit from having a single source of truth to lean on. This type of organization is able to operate with almost supernatural efficiency. An organization that does *not* put concerted effort into structured documentation has no choice but to watch its team members ask and re-ask for the same bits of data in perpetuity, creating a torturous loop of interruptions, meetings, and suboptimal knowledge transfers. 

## Start now

A top concern from established co-located or hybrid-remote organizations who wish to transition to all-remote is their tardiness in creating a company handbook. This sentiment is also shared by companies that maintain separate offices — which are remote to each other — who long to lay the groundwork necessary for teams to collaborate seamlessly.

It's important not to let hindsight thwart progress in the here and now. While an ideal time to begin a company handbook is at inception, the next best time is *today*. 

## Do not rely on Slack to be the Single Source of Truth

At Takeoff, we use slack to communicate more than *any other method*. This can, and has been, harmful to us and our customers, because we use it as a tool for managing projects end-to-end. Slack, Microsoft Teams, and similar tools are *instant* messaging platforms, which may work to the detriment of a truly [asynchronous culture](/about-takeoff/culture. 

Ensuring that our team can rely on a [single source of truth](/docs/handbook/handbook-styleguide/#documentation-is-the-single-source-of-truth-ssot) means being strict when it comes to mitigating reliance on instant messages and message retention. If our team relies on searching through instant message history for updates on a given project, there is no motivation to document progress in a place that is universally accessible. This creates massive knowledge gaps and further splinters communication, alignment, and understanding throughout the organization.

A limited retention policy can act as a forcing function. It nudges team members to discuss work matters in a location that is directly tied to the ultimate single source of truth. At Takeoff, all Engineering knowledge, processes, and policies are to be documented in this handbook. 

To get there, discussions begin in Jira tickets, in Github Issues, and/or Merge Requests — **not in Slack**. This ensures that whatever is merged into the handbook has a proper trail, full of context that is universally accessible. 

Instant messaging tools are difficult to add people to a conversation, and all work history is left in that program, with no context following the work to where it eventually ends up. 

It's difficult to rally an organization to avoid relying on Slack for formal information, but it's worth the effort. **Relying on Slack too much ensures a tortuous pattern of people pinging people for updates and snippets of information, adding further fuel to the chaotic fire that is synchronous workflows.** 

## Don't get overwhelmed

There's a very real fear that committing to a handbook, and instilling a culture of documentation, is too tall a task to actually accomplish. The goal should **not** be to complete the handbook before ever announcing its existence to the company.

For established organizations, the trick is to apply [iteration](/handbook/iteration) to the challenge of standing up a handbook within a company. Put the proper infrastructure in place (which we'll cover below), and begin documenting process after process, one at a time. Building a handbook well after a firm's infancy is tough, as you're changing both process and culture while operating a business at scale. However, leaders can manage expectations to make the handbook's insertion easier to grok. 

## Documentation is never finished

Handbooks, and the documentation that creates them, are never finished. They are evolving, living entities, and it may take months or years to feel even remotely comprehensive. 

Resist the urge to abandon documentation plans when crisis hits. The most powerful documentation is that which is derived from failure. A lesson learned provides a vital roadmap of what to avoid, and how to operate better, in the future. 

## Tools for building a handbook

A common belief is that a company wiki can serve as a handbook, but the reality is that wikis do not scale. They are designed to be updated by a select few, which creates several issues. One, content frequently falls out of date, which triggers a companywide belief that the information cannot be trusted without personally confirming with another human (and in turn, injecting inefficiency into the process of self-learning. 

Two, it creates class segmentation — those entrusted to update the wiki, and those who are not yet wise or elite enough to do so. 

Wikis are also highly siloed. They do not support proposals which touch multiple parts of multiple pages.

- Takeoff uses Github to maintain and evolve its handbook. By leveraging version control, anyone in the Engineering organisation is empowered to put forth proposals for improvement. 
- [Almanac](https://almanac.io/home) is an excellent tool for organizations building their first handbook. It allows you to pull in expert guides from other companies ([like Gitlab](https://almanac.io/articles/11830/remote-survival-guide-for-managers)) and modify to suit your company. This shortens the time between acknowledging that a handbook is necessary and having a minimum viable product available for your team to reference and iterate on.

### The entire team is empowered to evolve the handbook

Crucially, merge requests split the role of submitter and approver. This handbook is open to proposals, and code owners and directly responsible individuals are ultimately responsible for reviewing each proposal and merging or editing and merging. 

This enables anyone at the on the engineering team, even those who have just joined, to propose changes and feel immediately invested in a Takeoff's culture of documentation. 

## Handbook-first documentation is a value

The trick to ensuring a handbook grows continually is to instill it as a value. Team members should recognize that any answer or solution that isn't yet documented, *should* be documented immediately.

Documentation has to be instilled as a value. It has to start there, and the whole leadership team in an organization has to be onboard. 

Everyone on Takeoff Engineering needs ot understand the importance of documentation — not just with lip service. A true, genuine understanding of its value. If we*truly* understand the value of it, it will emanate to everyone at this company. 

## Designated Handbook editor team

Ideally, everyone feels as if they are a contributing member of a handbook's evolution. This is easier to foster when documentation is instilled as a value at an early stage. Scaled companies adding a handbook many years after inception often hire dedicated scribes that sit on each team. 

At Takeoff we have a handbook editorial or code review team that ensures the engineering framework is up to date, and that code owners are notified whenever pages go too long without an update. 

## Contribute your lessons

Approaching documentation with unwavering intention is a challenge for all companies. If you have prior experience that would benefit this handbook, consider creating a merge request and adding a contribution to this page.
