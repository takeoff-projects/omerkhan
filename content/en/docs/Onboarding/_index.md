## On the ground floor of Micro-Fulfillment

At Takeoff, we work with grocers to integrate our automated grocery fulfillment solution into their existing business. Our Micro-Fulfillment Center sits inside their store, working alongside their employees to fulfill orders. We give grocers the flexibility to embrace eCommerce on their own terms.

Takeoff was founded in the fall of 2016 by José V. Aguerrevere and Max Pedró. Both Max and José bring a wealth of knowledge and passion for grocery from over a decade of executive experience in the grocery industry.  Since then, Takeoff has flourished.  We are at over 200 employees and growing!
