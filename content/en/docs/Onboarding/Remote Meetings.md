# Google Meet
## Google meet Etiquette

* If you want to comment/ input/ speak please use the raise hand function so that the facilitator is aware and can ensure you get to speak.  If the facilitator advises at the beginning of the meeting that you do not need to do this then it is Ok to just speak out.

* Be present, do not continue to work on other things, be on your phone messaging people in slack during the meeting.  This can be distracting and also insulting to the meeting facilitator an other attendees.

* Ensure that there is an agenda / purpose for the meeting included in the description / invite so the attendee can decide if the meeting is of value to them or that they feel they can add value.

* Provide feedback to meeting owner if you are declining a meeting. Do not just decline.
