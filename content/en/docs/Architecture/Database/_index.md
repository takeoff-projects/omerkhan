    *Unified standards for database development at Takeoff*
---

{{% pageinfo %}}
Welcome to the space for all things database! Here you'll find the guidelines and expectations for database development at Takeoff, as maintained by the Database Architecture Guild. Our goal is to standardize database development across the organization to promote best practices, ensure quality, and reduce friction as developers move between projects.

## Contributing
Developers should always attempt to adhere to these standards for database development. However, the DB Guild fully recognizes the need to adapt these standards as new use cases and technologies present themselves. If you find that there are shortcomings with the existing standards in practice or have new needs that aren't addressed here, please raise these concerns with us so that we can continue to improve. We welcome all feedback and ideas!
