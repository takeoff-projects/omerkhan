  Communication Channels and Naming Conventions
---

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}} Although this page geared towards Slack channels and groups. The same naming conventions are meant to apply for all of our systems (Slack, OpsGenie, GitHub, Okta, G-Suite, etc.)  to make browsing groups and finding the right one for your needs more intuitive. {{% /alert %}}

---

## General rules for naming:

*   Dashes (not underscores)
*   All lowercase
*   Keywords are fully qualified (“engineering” over “eng”, “product” over “prod”, “operations” over “ops”)
*   Well-known abbreviations allowed (“cop” for “Community of Practice”)
*   Hierarchy should be indicated by starting broad and getting narrower
*   Suffixes should be used as a modifier to any channel/group name (ie. `-private` is the private version of any channel)
    

## Teams (Okta Groups, Google Groups, and Slack Groups)
