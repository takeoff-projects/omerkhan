description: Our ways of working within the domains
---

**Food for thought:** You can buy a person’s time and effort with money, but you can’t buy their **passion or ingenuity** — those are only given willingly if you have a person come to think their work is valuable and important and they’ll be recognized for their achievements.

**Happy and Invested Teams** = **PRODUCTIVE TEAMS.** We will invest in building a better **CULTURE.**

Culture we MUST Embrace
-----------------------

* More **focus**, manageable/controllable processes
    
* **Quality,** teams that are accountable and self regulated
    
* <span style="color:green">**Structure**</span> to enable the cultural change: in the way we organize and apply Agile, in the tools we use to develop, in how we <span style="color:green">**approach quality**</span>
    
* **Ownership and Accountability**
    
* Professional growth
    
* Collaborative
    
* Culture of **transparency**
    
* Lean waste management
    

Ways to Improve Collaboration
-----------------------------

|Working with our Takeoff framework, the Domain commits to: |  |
|:--|--:|
| <br> <ul><li>Product Goals</li><li>Sprint Goals</li><li>Shared Definition of Ready/Done</li></ul> | ![](/images/en/docs/agile/ImproveCollaboration.png)|


**Create the culture of “OWNERSHIP”**

The “**what**” and the “**how**” are important in the daily job of a team member. But the “**why**” we are doing things, is even more important. As a Team/Domain we need to feel safe asking questions and challenging the Product Backlog and <span style="color:green">**ultimately take ownership, pride and be accountable** </span>for everything we do.

**Effective refinement** require asking the right kinds of questions, based on the **problem you are trying to solve.** If you keep raising questions, you will keep finding better answers and implementing exactly what should be done.

**Team collaboration** is an important factor for team success. The Scrum Master should watch the status of the collaboration, and **continuously improve** it.

Dependencies
------------
|<span style="color:green">“Don’t manage dependencies, break them!" </span>|  |
|:--|--:|
| Waiting time (aka dwell time) is one of the biggest forms of waste on any software project. The most common forms of waiting time come from blockers, too much WIP, rework, dependencies, drag factors and weak system policies. <br> <br>In our new structure every Domain will have a <span style="color:green">Dependency Board</span> that will managed by the **Scrum Masters.** Dependencies will be identified during Refinement.<br><br>The Domain Leaders will be **strategic** in their ways of <span style="color:red">**reducing/eliminating cross-team dependencies.**</span>|<br><br>![](/images/en/docs/agile/dependencies2.png)|

### How we Manage our dependencies

This process applies from early quarterly planning to delivery of work.

Initial high level dependency mapping during quarterly planning should be done at Epic level in Jira.

* Each quarter the PO should create an Epic for each of the Gold, Silver and Bronze initiatives. 
    
* All issue types should have a quarterly initiative type (GSB) label added.
    

### Management of dependencies in Jira

We manage **external dependencies** by utilising the **“dependency” issue linking pairing**. i.e. dependencies that are outside of the team. The pairings are:

* Is dependent on 
    
* is depended upon by
    

_Please Note: This link type is to be used **only** for dependencies outside the team. Dependencies **internal to a team** can use the traditional **blocks (blocks; is blocked by)** link type._    

| |  |
|:--|:--:|
| <br><br><br>The team that “is dependent upon” another team is r**esponsible for managing** the dependency. **Note:** any identified dependency should be discussed with the other team in a timely manner so that the work can be planned and agreed in advance. The team SM / KM is responsible for making sure dependencies are managed. | _Team A identifies they have a dependency on Team B for a piece of work. The 2 teams discuss the need and Team B agrees to do the work needed by Team A_ <br> ![](/images/en/docs/agile/Dependencyflow.png) |

* For **each** dependent ticket (i.e. the ticket that <span style="color:green">“is dependent on”</span>):
    
    * where there is an existing corresponding Jira issue, the issues should be linked via the dependency link functionality. 
        
    * The “Dependency Description” field in the issue dependencies section needs to be updated with informative information such as:
        
        * What is the dependency?
            
        * What is the impact of this dependency if it is not delivered?
            
        * The team(s) delivering the dependency for the issue.
            
    * The agreed delivery date should be captured in the “Agreed Delivery Date” field.  For a scrum team this is likely to be the end date of the sprint in which they are delivering the dependency.  The team must then ensure that the dependency is monitored and tracked.
        

This data allows us to create reporting and / or dashboards for all dependencies and for individual teams to understand their dependencies.

Frameworks
----------

### Domain Product Backlog

**Each Backlog will consist of:**

* 50% Roadmap Items with clear value, validation and Product Goals (owned by DPO) **NEGOTIABLE**
    
* 45% Engineering Backlog (owned by DDE/DA) **NEGOTIABLE**
    
* 5% Personal Backlogs (owned by individual Team members) <span style="color:red">**NOT NEGOTIABLE***</span>
    

#### **Domain Product Backlog Refinement**

**The advantages Cross-Team Refinement offer are:**

* **Refinement** will happen **DAILY**
    
* Allows Scrum Teams to <span style="color:green">**identify dependencies**</span> between Product Backlog items as early as possible and seek to reduce them so individual Scrum Teams can work more independently during Sprints.
    
* Helps to <span style="color:green">**reduce big batches or work**</span> and reduce complexity by breaking large pieces of functionality down into smaller more manageable units. This helps with the creation and testing of new features and increases the probability of each Scrum Team achieving a done Increment by the end of their Sprint.
    
* Allows Scrum team members time to explore and understand upcoming Product Backlog items <span style="color:green">**in advance of the Sprint in which they will be implemented.**</span>
    
* Facilitates the input of multiple Scrum teams into the exploration, detailing and estimating of each Product Backlog Item (Supports SLE’s). This helps ensure a greater understanding of the work required to deliver the item.
    
* <span style="color:green">**Allows the Scrum Teams to guide the Domain Product Owner**</span> in the <span style="color:green">**efficient prioritization**</span> of the Product Backlog.
    

#### **Introduction to the Domain Refinement Board**

Each domain project has a refinement board on which they can view and manage all tickets currently within the refinement process.

**Refinement process**

Issues in the **Backlog** are selected as READY TO REFINE when the Leadership are ready for the issues to be refined by the team. Up to 2 issues should be selected for discussion at daily refinement sessions and these are moved to the REFINEMENT status when work to refine them has begun. Once issues have been refined and they meet the Definition of Ready, they are moved to the REFINED status and are prioritised in the backlog ready for consideration for an upcoming sprint.

![](/images/en/docs/agile/refinement%20board.png)

### Scrum or Kanban

Each team in a Domain follows either the Scrum or Kanban framework. There may be a combination of both within a Domain.

The framework selection will be done alongside Adele Housley or Matthew Barnes and should complement the team backlog.

Teams will not deviate from these framework unless agreed by Adele or Matthew.

#### **Kanban**

**Desired Outcome:** Prioritized value work items to have continuous flow to reduce cycle time.

**3 Roles** – KM, PO, Team (cross-functional and/or specialized teams)

**4 Events** – Refinement, Prioritization, Review, Retro

**1 Artifact** – Domain Roadmap


##### **Kanban Rules**

* Continuous Flow
    
* WiP Limits adhered to
    
* Daily Scrum
    
* Adopt Scrum events for continuous improvement
    
* Pull do NOT Push
    
* Have a Time-box GOAL
    
* If blocked SWARM
    
* Be Data Driven
    

##### WIP limit rules

<span style="color:red">**Stop Starting and Start Finishing**</span>

* Once a piece of work is finished, instead of immediately pulling a new item from the backlog, first, go through the cards on the board. Start from the far most right-side column (the one before Done), then go towards the beginning of the workflow.
    
* Look for items that are not assigned to anyone, any issues that need to be fixed (even if they are not assigned to you), anything that’s waiting for code review or implement feedback from code review.
    
* A new item of work should only be started if there is literally nothing that you can do to help the ongoing work items move forward in the process.
    

#### **Scrum**

**Desired Outcome:** <span style="color:red">Defined Value achieved to reach Product/Sprint Goal at the end of each iteration</span> 

**3 Roles** – SM, PO, Devs (fully cross-functional)

**3 Artifacts** – Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment

**3 Commitments** – Product Goal, Sprint Goal, Definition of Done

**3 Pillars** – Transparency, Inspect, Adapt

**5 Events** – Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Planning, Retro

##### **Team Sprint Backlog**

**Each Backlog will consist of:**

* 50% PBIs with clear value, value, validation and Sprint Goals (owned by Devs + PO)
    
* 45% Engineering Backlog (owned by Devs with support from DDE+DA)
    
* 5% Personal Backlogs (owned by individual Team members)
    

| Unplanned work in a sprint|  |
|:--|--:|
| Within a sprint, ideally there should be no work added to the sprint. However the occasional **silver bullet** is allowed. items that can be categorised as Silver bullets are: <ul><li> _Any work that is required to achieve the Sprint Goal_</li><li>Sev 1 issues</li><li>Bugs that are impacting production in live sites</li></ul> | ![](/images/en/docs/agile/silver%20bullet.jpeg)|


**Note:** the DDE should be informed and approve before work is accepted into Sprint

* the DDE should be informed and approve before work is accepted into Sprint
    
* Any work item that **DOES NOT** meet the DoR will be <span style="color:red">**REJECTED**</span>
    
* Any work item (dependency) that is presented later than 2-days prior to Sprint end will be <span style="color:red">**REJECTED**</span> (exc. Sev 1s)
    

Should any work be brought in that does not meet this criteria, the Jira issue must have the **unplanned** label added to it

##### **Sprint Rules**

|  **IF…..**    |  **THEN…..**    |
| :--- | :--- |
| A defect is found (in scope) | <ul><li> Add defect to current Sprint (top of backlog)</li><li>Re-test parent issue after defect is resolved</li></ul>|
| A defect is found (out of Scope) | <ul><li>Triage with the team</li></ul>|
| A Dependency/blocker arises | <ul><li> Make it visible</li><li>Prioritize resolving dependency/blocker: swarm, pair, mob</li></ul> |
| A new learning arises | <ul><li>Review with Team and adapt/re-negotiate Sprint Scope</li></ul> |
| A new request arises | <ul><li>Re-route request to PO</li><li>Create new issue in PB for PO to prioritize</li><li>Take it through the usual refinement process if accepting in Sprint</li></ul> |
| You run out of work | <ul><li>Swarm, pair, mob and escalate on issues in-flight of highest value</li><li>Align with team on pulling new work in (if it can be completed in Sprint or work on personal backlog</li></ul> |

#### Professional Scrum with Kanban (PSK)

Each Scrum team will use elements of Kanban and will follow the PSK format.

**What does this mean?**

The teams will:

* Have Work in Progress (WIP) limits
    
* Optimise their workflow
    
    * Optimizing flow requires defining what flow means in a Scaled Scrum context for Takeoff. Each Scrum Team must create its definition of "Workflow" containing the following elements:
        
        * Workflow must contain a definition of how Work in Progress (WIP) will be limited
            
        * Cycle Time: The amount of elapsed time between when a work item "starts" and when a work item "finishes.“
            
        * Work Item Age (WIA): The amount of elapsed time between when a work item "started" and the current time.
            
        * We will be introducing SLE’s so WIA is key for this to happen
            
        * Throughput: The number of work items "finished" per unit of time. Note the measurement of throughput is the exact count of work items.
            

#### Scrum and Kanban teams waiting time.

Workflows for all teams will have waiting columns added to their workflows so we can visualise and identify **Waiting time**

##### **What is WAITING Time?**

Project boards are used to visualise your flow of work and to see how issues are and more importantly aren’t progressing. For many teams there is often a lag between when certain activity is complete and the next activity starts e.g. when a piece of code is complete and requires a code review, but no-one is available to start the review immediately. This lag is called 'Waiting Time”. Waiting times can be experienced through a number of causes e.g. dependencies or too much work in progress.

**Why is this important to know?**

It can help a team understand bottlenecks and from that identify ways to improve their **flow efficiency**, thus **improving cycle times**.

There is a simple equation by which you can calculate your flow efficiency.

| |  |
|:--|--:|
|You identify the amount of time an issue was actively being worked (**work time**) on and the amount of time an issue was waiting for action (**wait time**). With this information, you divide your work time by your work time plus your wait time and multiply by 100. This results in your percentage efficiency flow. <br> <br> In the example provided, an issue had 16 hours of actual work time and 59 hours of 59 hours giving a cycle time of 75 hours. So 16 divided by 75 (16 + 59) = 0.21. Multiply that by 100 = 21. so the flow efficiency for that issue was 21%| <br><br>![](/images/en/docs/agile/flowefficiency.png) |

**So how can a team identify their waiting time to understand their flow efficiency and bring about improvement?**

To do this, we utilise waiting columns on our Jira boards, see columns identified on the screenshot below.

When you have completed a doing activity, you move the issue into the “activity done” column where it sits to wait for when it can be picked up for the next activity rather than it sit in a doing column whilst it is not being actively worked on.

For example, as a team member completes his development task, he moves the item into the **Dev Done** column. When the code reviewer is ready to review the item, she pulls it into the **In Review** column.

![](/images/en/docs/agile/waitingcolumns.png) 

We have a tool in Jira called **status time** with which teams can pull information about how long an item or group of items have spent in each column. This helps identify time spent waiting and this data is then utilised to identify what the specific bottlenecks were and the team can look at what improvement could be made to reduce the waiting time.

Personal Backlogs
-----------------

No growth without innovation **OR** learning…. We will set the expectation that EVERY Team member dedicate time to investing in ongoing upskilling and reskilling.

Each Team will have a personal backlog (Epic) with tickets added for each team member for their personal backlog items. These will be reviewed by their manager that is dedicated to support them with upskilling, career development and achieving personal goals.

We need to learn how to play like an orchestra so personal backlogs and Guilds will help us play sweet music together.

Metrics
-------

There are a number of metrics we currently capture for different levels:

* Organisation - Downtime and severity 1s
    
* Team and Domain, see table
    

|**Metric**   | **Team**     | **Domain**     |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Velocity | :white_check_mark: |     |
| Tech debt completed | :white_check_mark: |     |
| Unfinished tickets | :white_check_mark: |     |

| MAX Lead Time RCA tickets | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| Median Lead Time RCA tickets | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |

Each team and Domain has reporting capabilities and a confluence page that provide a visual view of the metrics across six sprints / iterations, showing upward or downward trends in the metrics. Overall commentary and metric specific commentary is added by the Scrum / Kanban Masters, alongside Domain leadership at the domain level.

You can find all reports by visiting the confluence space [Sprint Reports](https://takeofftech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AG/pages/1317339170/Sprint+Reports)
