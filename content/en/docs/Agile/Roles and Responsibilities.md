Domain Leadership
-----------------

### Why Have the Domain Leaders?

* Collaborative leaders play to their strengths and empower their team to do the same.
    
* Collaborative leaders increase ownership, accountability and engagement.
    
* Because collaborative leaders have a greater understanding of others’ abilities, they can delegate effectively, according to strengths.
    
* One person in each Domain should no longer be expected to bear sole responsibility or provide direction without being able and willing to draw on the advice of others.
    
Whatever our strengths, and however honed our leadership skills, we’ll always need others to fill in the gaps. This should be acknowledged and embraced as a source of strength.

#### The Domain Leaders will be Responsible for the Key Dynamics

<span style="color:green">**Psychological safety:**</span> Can we take risks in these teams without feeling insecure or embarrassed?

_Team members must feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other_

<span style="color:green">**Dependability:**</span> Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?

_Team members should get things done in the right way, at the right time and meet Takeoff’s high bar for excellence and quality_

<span style="color:green">**Structure & clarity:**</span> Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?

_Team members fully understand the Product Goal, Technical Goals and Sprint Goals. They will understand their roles and will build a Sprint Plan based on the HOW._

<span style="color:green">**Meaning of work:**</span> Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us (personal backlogs)? _All work should be personally important to all Team members._

<span style="color:green">**Impact of work:**</span> Do we fundamentally believe that the work we’re doing matters and adds value?

_Team members should think that their work matters and creates positive, innovative change with our customers needs in mind._
