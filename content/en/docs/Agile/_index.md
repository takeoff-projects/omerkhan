Agile at Takeoff
----------------

Takeoff needs to deliver high quality/high value at a sustainable pace that meets the customer requirements. The organisation is developing its agile ways of working. We started off with scrum and followed it to the letter. Our Agile improvement curve reached diminishing returns that required important changes that will  <span style="color:green">**honour the achievements**</span> made by our teams up to now and <span style="color:green">**prepare us all for a new level of professional and personal growth.**</span>

### Early-Stage Agile

Agile is a journey. No organization can implement all the elements of Agile on Day One.

Mastering the various facets of Agile takes time, at Takeoff we are in <span style="color:green">**“Early-Stage Agile.”**</span> It's <span style="color:red">**not fake Agile**</span>: it's Agile that is **incomplete.**

As our journey proceeds we will incrementally master all <span style="color:green">**the three Laws of Agile**</span> as well as **strategic agility.**

The journey never ends:  we will continue finding new ways to become ever more agile.

#### The 3 laws of Agile

<span style="color:green">**The Law of the Customer**</span> — an obsession with delivering value to customers as the be-all and end-all of Takeoff.

<span style="color:green">**The Law of the Small Team**</span> — all work be carried out by small self -organizing teams, working in short cycles and focused on delivering value to customers.

<span style="color:green">**The Law of the Network**</span>— a continuing effort to  eliminate top-down hierarchy so that we operate as an interacting network of teams, all focused on working together to deliver increasing value to customers.

We Need to Make an IMPACT
-------------------------

<span style="color:red">**I**</span>**nteresting:** Does the product address the things our customers really care about? Can we tell a story of how the product creates positive change for them?

<span style="color:red">**M**</span>**eaningful:** Are we moving the business forward toward measurably reaching its goals? Are we providing real value to our users?

<span style="color:red">**P**</span>**eople:** Who is impacted by our product? Who uses it, who sees the benefits, and who pays for it?

<span style="color:red">**A**</span>**ctionable:** Are we producing ideas that can be implemented and realized? Do we have the resources, budget, and expertise to execute?

<span style="color:red">**C**</span>**lear:** Do we truly understand what we’re trying to do? Can it be concisely articulated so even a child could understand?

<span style="color:red">**T**</span>**estable:** Can you try things out before making a significant commitment? Are there ways to experiment and measure success on an ongoing basis?
