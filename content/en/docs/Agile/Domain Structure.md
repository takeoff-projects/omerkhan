The Best Bits of Agile
----------------------

For the next step of our Agile maturity we have built a framework based on what we consider to be the best bits from a number of Agile frameworks.

Like everything in an Agile environment, we know we may have to change our processes with each iteration.

We are <span style="color:red">**NOT**</span> declaring this Framework is perfect, it has been designed for the needs of Takeoff and we will iteratively <span style="color:green">**EVOLVE**</span>

|We have included elements from: |  |

|**Spotify** (Guilds) <br>**Lean** (Value Streams and reduction of Waste)<br>**SAFe** (Structured Domains)<br>**Nexus** (One Product Backlog per Domain)<br>**Kanban** (WiP, Flow)<br>**Scrum** (Heartbeat Cadence)| ![](/images/en/docs/agile/Agilemethods.png)

High Level View of our Collaborative Domain Structure
-----------------------------------------------------

![](/images/en/docs/agile/TODomains.png)

We will go into more detail of this picture below. But before we do, we’d like to highlight the Benefits of a Collaborative Domain

### Benefits of a Collaborative Domain

**Collaboratively working** in a Domain/team **brings concrete benefits**. Not only from a relational point of view but also from a productive point of view.

**Reduction of processing times**: when several people work cooperatively on the same project, they are focused and aligned. This avoids rework and mis-understandings and it is possible to reduce the delivery times of a project. Cooperatively working is addressed by the Scrum values of **“Courage” **and** “Focus”.**

**Mutual exchange of skills and ideas**: having multiple points of view on the same topic allows you to create a complete and multifaceted product. This is addressed by the Scrum values of **“Respect” **and** “Openness”.**

**Ability to rely on your teammates**: if a member of the group is in difficulty or is going through a moment of discouragement, it is essential that the other members of the (emotional awareness) and can support him/her adequately. Helping teammates is addressed by the Scrum values of **“Commitment” **and** “Focus”.**

**No more spreading ourselves thin**: currently having 1 team per domain and not getting enough done because there are too many external dependencies is causing deadlocks.

Takeoff Engineering Domain Structure Detail
-------------------------------------------

**Multiple Teams** working on a related feature area **make a Domain**.

For each Domain:

* **One Domain Product Owner (DPO),** – More strategic than tactile and owns the PB, Vision and Product Roadmap and Product Goals and is accountable for maximizing Domain Value and setting **PRIORITIES**
    
* **One Domain Director of Engineering (DDE) –** Acts as Team Manager
    
* **One Domain Architect(DA)** who is responsible **for creating a productive and innovative environment for the Scrum teams.**
    
* **Area Product Owner (APO)** – One or Several APO’s in each Domain supporting the DPO and Sprint PO’s
    
* **One or more Sprint Product Owners (SPO) (who can have 1-3 teams)** – More tactile. Supports DPO and works with them to manage the PB, is fully accountable for the optimization of Their  own Team value
    
* **One or More Team Scrum or Kanban Masters (who can have 1-3 teams) –** Owns the agreed Team framework and process tools, supports Incident Managers and manages dependencies, blockers and data driven metrics
    
* **One roadmap, one Product Backlog** which will build all the Domain Teams Sprint Backlogs.
    
* **1-5 Dev Teams** \- This will be no more that 5 team members and will be cross-functional (where possible, but layer teams may be introduced) understanding that **all Devs (anyone in the Team who is not PO or SM)** are **fully responsible and accountable** of **delivering a valuable increment to the DoD every Sprint** (eventually).
    
    * **Each Team** will share a **Product Goal, but their Sprint Goals may differ**.
        
    * **Developers'** main responsibility will be to **CODE, TEST, DEPLOY & RELEASE.**
        
* **Every 6 weeks a Domain Charter** will be put in place where each Team in their Domain **showcase work completed, metrics, lessons learned, competitor awareness training and any changes in technologies and architecture**.
    
* **Domain leaders (DPO, DDE & DA)** will find the ways to **eliminate the problematic dependencies, especially blockers** and **cross-team dependencies**
    
* **Organizational Support & Escalation**– The team will have a defined process for problem-solving support, for technical issues as well as “soft” issues via a clear and defined escalation route

An Example Scenario: Issue Reporting for Product Org
----------------------------------------------------

An account manager receives feedback from a client that certain items show the wrong item name when being decanted, but not while being picked or manually put away. The account manager reaches out to the inbound team -- the Domain Product Owner and the Area Product Owner(s). Who should do what in this situation?”

Escalation Points
-----------------

* **Line Manager OR Domain Leadership**
    
* Guild Co-Ordinator
    
* Matthew Barnes – Engineering & Architecture & **ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING ELSE**
    
* Adele Housley - Scrum/Kanban
    
* Mary Kauffman - Product

The Domain Charter
------------------

![](/images/en/docs/agile/Charter.png)

### What is the Purpose of the Domain Charter?

* Alignment across the Organization
    
* Update on confidence levels across the Organizational Roadmap and Scope
    
* Prioritization commitment/agreement
    
* Identify and discuss areas of WASTE
    
* Customer updates
    
* Employee headcount and health
    
* Finance approval
    
* Full understanding of the Why, Who, What, When, Where, How…
    
* Discussion on Assumptions, Dependencies (internal & external), Hard Milestones
    

### Events (Domain Charter)

* We think in 3 sprint domains CADENCE
    
* Review goal(s) and progress
    
* Review Increment and validate the success criteria and customer satisfaction trends (EBM)
    
* Review Workflows and identified bottlenecks (value stream mapping)
    
* Full Domain Retro for continuous improvements
    
* Review metric trends
    
* Supports Future Planning (Business objectives, Roadmaps, Hiring)
    
* Ensure alignment between Product, Engineering, Architecture
    

### Example of a Domain Charter Roadmap Item…

**Problem Statement:**

* What is wrong, not working and not meeting our customers needs?
    
* What is the frequency of the problem?
    
* What is the impact of the problem on our customers/business or employees?
    
* What is the financial impact of the project and/or problem?
    

**Business Goal:**

* (Increase/Decrease) …… to a target (goal/% levels by (date projected for target result)
    

**Business Case:**

* Why is this project worth doing?
    
* Why is it important to do it now?
    
* What are the consequences of delay?
    
* How does this fit in with our current initiatives?
    

**Nominated Domain:**

* Domain Name
    
* Priority order
    
* Approx number of Sprints
    
* Target Date:
    
* Sponsor: (Product/Engineering/Architecture)
    

### Who Participates in the Domain Charters?

* All Domain Leaders
    
* C-Suite whenever possible
    
* SME’s (Design, Finance, HR, Support, Implementation Directors)
    
* Area and Sprint PO’s
    
* Scrum Masters
    
* Other Stakeholders that are relevant to the current Roadmap
