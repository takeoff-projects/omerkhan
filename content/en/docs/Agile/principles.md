A Gentle Reminder of the 12 Agile Principles
--------------------------------------------
 <br>

### Principle 1: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

 | |  |
|:--|--:|
|work on the right priority, at the right time focusing on quality, value, customer satisfaction and scalability. <br> <br> By having one roadmap per domain, the Guilds in place, and the 3 Domain Leadership with a clear escalation route we believe we can achieve all of this by continuous, iterative, and Domain collaboration.| ![](/images/en/docs/agile/Principle1.png)

### Principle 2: Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

<span style="color:green">To Embrace this Principle at Takeoff we WILL…</span>

| |  |
|:--|--:|
|Have effective feedback loops (Sprint Review, Pivot or Persevere), have empathy with our customers by responding to their needs and embracing changes we are currently making. We can only do this by improving our Sprint Reviews, Sev 1 RCA’s, understanding what is happening in the marketplace and allowing Developer's access to end-users and their empirical data.| ![](/images/en/docs/agile/Principle2.png)

### Principle 3: Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
