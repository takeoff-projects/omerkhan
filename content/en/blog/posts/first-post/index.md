[The Differences Between a Growth Mindset and a Fixed Mindset](https://www.screwtheninetofive.com/differences-between-growth-and-fixed-mindset)



Technology is constantly changing and organizations that foster a growth mindset differentiate those that embrace change as a positive agent from those who fear change and thus become slow to innovate. Takeoff Technologies strives to be a high functioning organization by investing in uplifting our Engineers to make use of the most cutting edge technology to 10x/100x multiply the capabilities of what we are able to deliver to our customers. It’s important to note that simply using cutting edge technologies is not enough, but educating ourselves to use them as designed - we need to make sure that we’re using hammers for nails and screwdrivers for screws (not the other way around) - and it will take some time to learn from experts and create opportunities for hands-on practice.

We have decided to lean into Go (an open-source programming language developed by Google) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and its service offerings (possibilities include: API Gateway, App Engine, Dataflow, Functions, Pub/Sub, Spanner, Workflow, etc.) Training up our Engineering team on these technologies will allow us to have richer conversations around our technology solution, design with quality baked in from the start, and get ourselves out of the maintenance and constant rework game. Teams will be proud of the things they’ve built and actual delivery/maintenance of our solution to customers will be so seamless and straightforward it will be taken for granted.

### Training will consist of 3 phases:

1. Learning
1. Validtaion
1. Reinforcement
New technologies/concepts will be introduced in the form of on-demand/scheduled classes, dedicated offsite sessions, learning modules, training exercises, and labs as everyone learns in different ways. The Engineering department will be expected to achieve selected certifications to validate their learning with additional certifications further down the line depending on your role/responsibilities. To make sure that these training sessions stick, we will be encouraging reinforcement mechanisms such as Formal/Informal Guilds, Centers of Excellence, Communities of Practice, etc.
